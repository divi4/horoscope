## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was made in a few hours, a lot of the time spent learning about animation as this was the first time I've really worked with them. 

## Planned Features

* Add option to allow users to input date in a dd/mm format
* Clean up and refactor code

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt how to made fading animations with this project and how to time it so that it would add to the experience as much as possible.
